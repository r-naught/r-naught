Hey!

Thanks for checking out my profile. 

I'm trying to learn too many things at once, but hopefully I can share some cool projects eventually.

My main interests are modding established video games and creating games of my own. Web design is equally interesting to me.

Not sure I ever want to make a career out of either of those things, but that's more than fine with me.

If I do ever find myself working in tech, I foresee a role in health & medicine since that's always been an interest of mine. (Hence my name)

Cheers,
R-naught
